# Traffic Sign Classification

Used a dataset of traffic sign images to perform image classification.

Created a Neural Network from scratch using numPy with an accuracy of 87%. Adam Optimizer was also implemented from scratch. Overfitting was reduced by using regularization and drop-out techniques. PCA was used to reduce image features, which accelerated training speed. 

The performance of the model was further improved by employing advanced CNN architectures with Keras such as Inception, Resnet, etc. 

In addition, I developed an advanced classifier using semi-supervised GAN. It is useful if we do not have the entire dataset labelled. This model was able to achieve 87% accuracy with just 20% labelled data.

Lastly, built an application using stream-lit where user uploads an image and the model classifies the traffic sign.
